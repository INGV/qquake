qgisMinimumVersion=3.0
description=A plugin that makes the download of seismological data from web services easy
version=1.2
author=Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV)
email=mario.locati@ingv.it

about=<p>With QQuake you may download various type of data related to earthquakes such as parameters from catalogues, macroseismic intensity observations, recording stations, or seismogenic faults.<br>The plugin is pre-configured with a series of webservices, and the user may add new configurations with additional services that can be later exported and shared with others.<p>In seismology, the most widely adopted standards for sharing data are those promoted by <a href="https://www.fdsn.org/webservices/">FDSN</a>, but they are not natively supported by QGIS. This plugin fix this problem by supporting the FDSN-event (<a href="https://quake.ethz.ch/quakeml">QuakeML 1.2</a>) and FDSN-station (<a href="https://www.fdsn.org/xml/station/">StationXML</a>) web service standards, as well as the macroseismic web service developed by the <a href="https://emidius.eu/AHEAD/">European Archive of Historical Earthquakes Data (AHEAD)</a> which is based on the <a href="https://quake.ethz.ch/quakeml/QuakeML2.0/Macroseismic">macroseismic package of QuakeML 2.0</a>. In addition, the plugin supports the inclusion of OGC WFS and WMS web services which are natively supported by QGIS, for a more complete set of data sources providing seismological data.</p><p>The plugin is designed by <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2185-3267">Mario Locati</a> from <a href="http://www.ingv.it/">Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV)</a> and developed by <a href="https://github.com/ghtmtt">Matteo Ghetta</a> from <a href="https://www.faunalia.eu/">Faunalia</a>, by <a href="https://github.com/nyalldawson">Nyall Dawson</a> and with the help of <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1208-9412">Roberto Vallone</a> from INGV.</p><p>You may find additional information at the <a href="https://www.emidius.eu/qquake/">QQuake homepage</a>.</p><hr />Data retrieved using the plugin is provided under the responsibility of the data provider of each selected web service.<br>Neither INGV, nor the plugin authors are responsible for the use that might be made of the data retrieved, nor are they responsible for any damage to third-parties caused by conclusions based on these data.<br>Data retrieved using the plugin may be altered with respects to the original data provided by the selected web services. Changes to the original data is required for loading data into QGIS as the original XML hierarchical structure must be converted into a flat table.</p><hr />
