description=QQuake plugin to download seismological data
version=development snapshot 2020 07 22
author=Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV)
email=mario.locati@ingv.it

about=QQuake is a plugin that makes the download of seismological data from existing web services easy.<br>By using it, you may download various type of data related to earthquakes, macroseismic observations, recording stations, seismogenic faults.<br>The plugin is pre-configured with a series of webservices, and the user may add new services and share their configuration at any time.<p>In seismology, the most widely adopted standards for sharing data are those promoted by <a href="https://www.fdsn.org/webservices/">FDSN</a>, but they are not natively supported by QGIS. This plugin supports the FDSN-event (<a href="https://quake.ethz.ch/quakeml">QuakeML 1.2</a>) and FDSN-station (<a href="https://www.fdsn.org/xml/station/">StationXML</a>) web services, as well as the macroseismic web service developed by the <a href="https://emidius.eu/AHEAD/">European Archive of Historical Earthquakes Data (AHEAD)</a>, and based on the <a href="https://quake.ethz.ch/quakeml/QuakeML2.0/Macroseismic">macroseismic package of QuakeML 2.0</a>. In addition, it supports any OGC WFS and WMS web services.</p><p>The plugin is designed by <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2185-3267">Mario Locati</a> from <a href="http://www.ingv.it/">Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV)</a> and developed by <a href="https://github.com/ghtmtt">Matteo Ghetta</a> from <a href="https://www.faunalia.eu/">Faunalia</a> and by <a href="https://github.com/nyalldawson">Nyall Dawson</a>.</p><hr />Data retrieved using this plugin is provided under the responsibility of the data provider managing each source web service.<br>Neither INGV, nor the plugin authors are responsible for the use that might be made of the data retrieved, nor are they responsible for any damage to third-parties caused by conclusions based on these data.<br>Data retrieved using the plugin may be altered with respects to the original data provided from the source web services due to data reprocessing required to load data into QGIS, typically due to the conversion from the original XML hierarchical structure into a flat table.<br>At this stage, the plugin should be considered experimental.</p><hr />
